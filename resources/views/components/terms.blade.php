<h2>THE ROGA & COPYTA™ INNOVATION MANAGER – General</h2>
<h4>ROGA & COPYTA™ Intangible Market and Innovation Manager™ Membership Rules</h4>
<h5>End User License Agreement</h5>
<h6>Purpose</h6>

<div>Much of the illiquidity in the over US$60 Trillion of intangible assets derives from concerns over maintaining
    confidentiality, and often anonymity, in relation to any potential transaction. To the extent permitted by
    applicable law, ROGA & COPYTA™ aims to create a “Community of Trust” in which those who own, license, create, buy,
    sell, or securitize intellectual property can conduct business with the assurance that:</div>

<div>The confidentiality of their intellectual property will be protected;
    Anyone accessing their intellectual property will do so under legal agreement to protect the owner’s basic rights
    and with the sole purpose of considering entering into a legal agreement to license rights to that property;
    The owner’s anonymity may be maintained if they wish; and
    There is a trusted third party that will vouch for the identity of all participants in the “Community of Trust” and
    can pass on general information such as levels of capitalization, industry and credit worthiness of participants
    while still maintaining anonymity.</div>

<div>These basic protections are provided through a combination of these Rules and the infrastructure and security built
    into the ROGA & COPYTA™ Innovation Manager™. With these protections in place, there is no reason that a marketplace
    for intellectual property cannot become as vibrant and efficient as those in other asset classes such as equities
    and bonds.</div>
